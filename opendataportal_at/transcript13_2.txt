question(data)>U>Great. While we are at it I thought you could also get me some data

list(keywords)>E>sure, [[odp austria]] always glad to serve
prompt(keywords)>E>how can I help you
list(keywords)>E>we have got [[tons of data sets]] on different [[topics]]

set(keywords)>U>I'm sure you do. But what really interests me is what you have on [[education]]

list(keywords)>E>let me check dear sir
    actually, not all that much, are you interested in [[a data set]] or [[news]] ?

set(keywords)>U>[[A data set]], of course

confirm()>E>perfect
list(keywords)>E>in this case, we only have one option, being a mapping of courses and organizations at wu, during different semesters
verify()>E>I do hope you are into that kinda stuff?

confirm()>U>I think it's fair to say that I have a fetish for stuff like tha

list(keywords)>E>so, which [[semester]] are you interested in? [[ws]]/[[ss]]?
    and which year? [[14]]/[[15]]/[[16]]?

set(keywords)>U>If [[SS]] stands for [[""summer""]] then that's what I'm after

confirm()>E>it sure does

set(keywords)>U>Do you also have data about [[later years]]?

bool(data)>E>sadly,
list(keywords)>E>[[16]] is the newest one we have
    [[2016]]

reject()>U>Oh, that's too bad

bool(data)>E>one moment 
    actually we do, it just has not been implemented into our categorical search yet

set(keywords)>U>Great, [[what year]] is it about?

list(keywords)>E>2017

confirm()>U>You are my hero
Can you get me that data set?

prompt(keywords)>E>so, anything specific you would like to know ?
confirm()>E>sure I'll send it over right away

confirm()>U>Oh yeah, almost forgot

link(dataset)>E>http://data.opendataportal....

question(data)>U>So the data set contains a list of organisations and what else? 

list(keywords)>E>we only have [[course ID's]] and [[organization ID's]] listed, no corresponding [[names]]

confirm()>U>Okay, nice.
set(keywords)>U>Could you give me [[a ""rough estimate""]] of [[how many courses]] there were?

confirm()>E>one moment 
count(data)>E>[[less than 1000]] [[courses]], but it is hard to evaluate, as some course ID's exist multiple times and some are left out entirely
    there is also no filtering tool available to remove duplicates

success()>U>Okay, understood. Thank you very much for trying!

count(data)>E>there is a maximum of [[871]] courses
    that is the closest i can get, sadly

success()>U>Thank you, darling 

success()>E>It was my pleasure
