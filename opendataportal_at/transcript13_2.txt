question(data)>U>Great. While we are at it [[I thought you could also get me some data]]G*

list(keywords)>A>sure, odp austria always glad to serve. [[how can I help you]]G* . we have got [[tons]]Q* of data sets on different [[topics]]F*

set(keywords)>U>I'm sure you do. But what really interests me is what you have on [[education]]E*

list(keywords)>A>let me check dear sir. actually, not all that much, are you interested in a [[data set]]E* or [[news]]E* ?

set(keywords)>U>A [[data set]]E*, of course

confirm()>A>[[perfect]]+* . in this case, we only have one option, being a [[mapping of courses and organizations at wu]]E* , during different [[semesters]]F* . I do hope you are into that kinda stuff?

confirm()>U>[[I think it's fair to say that I have a fetish for stuff like tha]]+*

list(keywords)>A>so, which [[semester]]F* are you interested in? [[ws]]E* /[[ss]]E* ? and which [[year]]F* ? [[14]]E* /[[15]]E* /[[16]]E* ?

set(keywords)>U>If [[SS]]E* stands for ""summer"" then that's what I'm after

confirm()>A>[[it sure does]]+*

set(keywords)>U>Do you also have data about [[later years]]F* ?

bool(data)>A>sadly, [[16]]E* is the newest one we have 2016

reject()>U>[[Oh, that's too bad]]-*

bool(data)>A>one moment [[actually we do]]+* , it just has not been implemented into our categorical search yet

set(keywords)>U>Great, what [[year]]F* is it about?

list(keywords)>A>[[2017]]E*

confirm()>U>[[You are my hero]]+* Can you get me that data set?

prompt(keywords)>A>so, anything specific you would like to know ? sure I'll send it over right away [[http://data.opendataportal....]]R*

question(data)>U>So the data set contains a list of organisations and what else? 

list(keywords)>A>we only have course ID's and organization ID's listed, no corresponding names

confirm()>U>Okay, nice. Could you give me a ""rough estimate"" of how many courses there were?

confirm()>A>one moment less than 1000 courses, but it is hard to evaluate, as some course ID's exist multiple times and some are left out entirely there is also no filtering tool available to remove duplicates

success()>U>Okay, understood. Thank you very much for trying!

count(data)>A>there is a maximum of 871 courses that is the closest i can get, sadly

success()>U>Thank you, darling 

success()>A>It was my pleasure
