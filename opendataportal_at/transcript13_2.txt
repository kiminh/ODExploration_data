U>Great. While we are at it I thought you could also get me some data

E>sure, odp austria always glad to serve
    how can I help you
    we have got tons of data sets on different topics

U>I'm sure you do. But what really interests me is what you have on [[education]]

E>let me check dear sir
    actually, not all that much, are you interested in a data set or news ?

U>A data set, of course

E>perfect
    in this case, we only have one option, being a mapping of courses and organizations at wu, during different semesters
    I do hope you are into that kinda stuff?

U>I think it's fair to say that I have a fetish for stuff like tha

E>so, which semester are you interested in? [[ws]]/[[ss]]?
    and which year? [[14]]/[[15]]/[[16]]?

U>If SS stands for ""summer"" then that's what I'm after

E>it sure does

U>Do you also have data about later years?

E>sadly, 16 is the newest one we have
    2016

U>Oh, that's too bad

E>one moment 
    actually we do, it just has not been implemented into our categorical search yet

U>Great, what year is it about?

E>2017

U>You are my hero
    Can you get me that data set?

E>so, anything specific you would like to know ?
    sure I'll send it over right away

U>Oh yeah, almost forgot

E>http://data.opendataportal....

U>So the data set contains a list of organisations and what else? 

E>we only have course ID's and organization ID's listed, no corresponding names

U>Okay, nice. Could you give me a ""rough estimate"" of how many courses there were?

E>one moment 
less than 1000 courses, but it is hard to evaluate, as some course ID's exist multiple times and some are left out entirely
    there is also no filtering tool available to remove duplicates

U>Okay, understood. Thank you very much for trying!

E>there is a maximum of 871 courses
    that is the closest i can get, sadly

U>Thank you, darling 

E>It was my pleasure
