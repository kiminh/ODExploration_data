E>my portal was [[opendataportal.at]] 

U>what was your contant

E>my conent is really local, so to speak. Many datasets contain information about [[local businesses]], [[products]], [[administration]] etc.
    also most of the sets are in [[csv]]
    I just saw that there are many data sets about [[the WU]] and [[the course organisation]]

U>oh cool do you think there is a data set about [[our courses in wu]]
    maybe from [[last semester]]

E>probably, the last one is from [[SS17]]

U>i would be know how much courses we have in a semester

E>I don't know whether this is the number of the cources but in this [[csv]] I found Ihave [[2577]] [[course_ids]]

U>oh ok can you describe it more

E>It essentially is a list with [[two]] columns, one [[course_id]] and one [[org_id]]
    [[course_id]] starts with [[4001]] and [[org_id]] with [[3798]]
    there are double entries, so neither of these two is unique

U>it could be the right one

E>do you have any questions left?

U>no
