or english is better for the sake of the experiment I think, so which portal do you have and how would you describe their content?

U @
my portal was goo.gl
what was your portal


P @
you sure? goo.gl is just a link shortener, wasn't your portal data.gv.at?
my portal was opendataportal.at


U @
oh yeah you are right sorry
what was your contant


P @
okay so how would you describe their content?my conent is really local, so to speak. Many datasets contain information about local businesses, products, administration etc.
also most of the sets are in csv
I just saw that there are many data sets about the WU and the course organisation


U @
oh cool do you think there is a data set about our courses in wu
maybe from last semester


P @
probably, the last one is from SS17


U @
i would be know how much courses we have in a semester


P @
I don't know whether this is the number of the cources but in this csv I found Ihave 2577 course_ids


U @
oh ok can you describe it more


P @
It essentially is a list with two columns, one course_id and one org_id
course_id starts with 4001 and org_id with 3798
there are double entries, so neither of these two is unique


U @
it could be the right one


P @
okay good - regarding a completely different matter, I am interested in names of young people in a communal called engerwitzdorf


U @
i found two different list with man and woman names in engerwitzdorf sorted after ages


P @
did you find anything about new names, maybe newborns or so? or is it possible to find out which names are the most popular, in relation to their age?


U @
born dates are from 2011


P @
okay and what is the most popular name in this category?


U @
Alexander 2 Elias 2 Felix 2 Jakob 2 Robin 2 Simon by men
Jasmin 2 Alina by women


P @
okay and one last question, how would you describe the content of data.gv.at?


U @
the content in data.gv.at are about austria
my conent is really local, too


P @
is it based on csv of other formats?


U @
this portal use many data formats


U @
for example csv, png

    Hi(partner)
    what portal did you use?

I used Open Data Portal Osterreich(me)

    what kind of datasets are there?

datasets related to our University(WU), a lot of data from Wirtschaftskammer Osterreich, and a few other datasets , for example from MUMOK, Osterreichische Lotterie etc.

    interesting
    what exactly are there related to the WU?

Mostly the mapping of courses in each different semester
    and also all campus rooms, all organizations,all course events and so on

    That might be something important for me. What can you tell me about last semester for example?

you mean ss17?

    yes

there is a total of 1950 records in this dataset, so that means 1950 different courses in the last semester

    Great, thats what i am searching for

i am glad
    and what about your portal?

    My portal was data.gv.at, an open data site for austria

what kind of data can you find there?

    You can search for all kinds of datasets, from economics to the political area but also everything regarded tot he life in austria education, sports, culture etc

what exactly do you mean life in austria? what is it all abou?

    Statistics about birthrates for example but also things like everyday aspects of life in Austria, where the kindergartens are, what you can do in the city
    Including public transport for exaple

that sounds nice, the topic of birtrates and kind of things interests me a lot, do you have any information about this in my hometown, in Engerwitzdorf?
    and also , what other data do you have , related to child births is Engerwitzdorf

    Well, I did not find exactly what you search, but I can tell you statistics about the places where newborn live or the names they get

that sounds all right, im curious about the names, which is the most popular?

    Men r women? Or overal?

    thats interesting

popular names 

    your task is about cities?

let be more specific

    please be

its about a city in upper austria
    thats all i can say

    interesting

maybe you should browse your open data website and tell me what you find

    and you have never heard of it or been there before

now, tell me what youre looking for
    no, haven't head of the city before
    think it's rahter small
    that's maybe a little help
    tell me what you have to do

    there are a lot of small cities in upper austria I guess

i know

    is it in a rather remote area?

yes i think so
    near linz
    just checked on google maps
    whats your task?

    well i cant tell you about my task explicitly I guess
    but it has something to do with universities

ok. go on
    in austria?

    yes

can you tell me which uni?

    well not explicitly
    but I let you guess 3 times

about lectures?
    grades?
    how long students study maybe?
    give me some hints

    well you arlready named it actually

how long students in austria study?

    You know, different univeristies offer different courses
    and these might be interesting
    just a tip

ok, so it has something to do with courses

    probably

which courses are offered at austrian unis?

    you are getting closer

or how many courses are offered by unis?
    or many studends attend those courses?
    maybe some hint

    its about lecutes yes
    these are offered by universities at different times
    maybe semesters?

how many lectures an average students takes per semester?

    stay away from students
    just about univeristies

how many lectures are offered per semester by an university in austria?

    thats nearly correct
    its about a specific univeristie
    y
    actually

how many lectures are offered per semester by WU on average?

    Imagine you are a student in 8th class and want to attend univeristy

which courses are offered in the first semester at wu

    so you start browsing the internet and might want to find out which courses are offered at a university

or how many lectures there are to attend in the first semester at wu

    and typically you might want to know what was offered in the last semester i guess
    alll courses
    because you would probably want to know what courses you could attend in the future

oh okay

    what is your guess?

maybe somehing like the wu lehveranstalungsverzeichnis

    good guess

where you can look at all courses, but also in specific at which semester to take which course

    yeah

the city is in the west of linz
    its rather small, say under 10.000 inhabitans
    sorry, in the east of linz
    it is near gallneunkirchen, i think i am allowed to say that
    just check google maps an tell me which city you see

    Ok, which one of us should start as the dataset-offering side?

you can start

    Alright then
    I can offer you datasets from data.gv.at
    You have 14 categories to choose from:

    - Arbeit
    - Bevölkerung
    - Bildung & Forschung
    - Finanzen & Rechnungswesen
    - Geographie & Planung
    - Gesellschaft & Soziales

    - Kunst & Kultur
    - Land & Forstwirtschaft
    - Sport & Freizeit
    - Umwelt
    - Verkehr
    - Verwaltung & Politik
    - Wirtschaft & Tourismus

    Which one do you need information from?

I will take ""Bevölkerung""

    Alright, do you need information about a specific state or about a specific town?

Yes, it will be a town called ""Engerwitzdorf""

    Ok, so you need information about a town in Upper Austria
    Du you need information about age, gender, ""Erwerbsstatus"", ""Wanderungen"", ""Familien"", ""Geburten"" or ""Sterbefälle""?

I hope its either in Familien or Geburten

    Ok, I found entries for Engerwitzdorf in family ata
    *data
    Do you need the amount of families in total, the amount of families without children, or similar?

Not really an amount, more a statistic about the names of the newbornes

    Alright, there's a seperate dataset for this
    So you need the most used first name for Engerwitzdorf?

correct

    male or female?
    and for what year?

nothing that exact, i need more of an overview

    ok, there are two datasets published by Engerwitzdorf
    One for male and one for female
    Both contain the information for the year 2011

OK i just need the most popular names

    Starting with the female dataset, there was only one name used more than once, which is ""Jasmin""
    All other names in the data set were used exactly once

one moment
    less than 1000 courses, but it is hard to evaluate, as some course ID's exist multiple times and some are left out entirely
    there is also no filtering tool available to remove duplicates
