U>Hello, anybody there?
    Hello?

E>hi
Yo. How can I help you?
    What are you looking for?    

U>well some data, hard to explain, what do you have to offer

E>We have a wide variety of data - lots of data about every single state in Austria, but also about areas like [[health]], [[culture]], [[traffic]] and [[infrastructure]]

U>hit me with some of the variants of state data

E>[[tourism]], [[economy]], [[finance]], [[geography]] .. - Does any of that sound interesting
    ?
    Oh, alright 

    what kind of stuff do you have to offer?

E>Any state that interests you more than others?

U>yep, upper austria

E>Great, let me check
    So, we have a lot of environmental data, election data, data about public spending, city planning data etc
    How does that sound?

U>anything more specific to certain cities in upper austria?
    so far nothing sounds to appealing.. maybe culture might also be possible...? not really sure either could fit
    *too

E>We have lots of data about Linz, for example. When searching for ""culture"" I get a lot of results for school data
    Is [[Linz]] the [[city]] you are most interested in? 

U>nope, [[a lot smaller]] would be prefarable

E>Okay, sure
    Maybe [[Engerwitzdorf]]?

U>yea that sounds cool

E>Great. I just found a data set about [[the most important establishments and institutions in Engerwitzdorf]]. Does that sound appealing at all? 

U>not really, don't you have anything more [[people]] related?

E>Didn't you say you wanted data related to [[culture]]?
    Just kidding, bear with me

U>I did... at least i was pretty sure
    you know, might also be a little shizophrenic, you never know

E>We have a data set listing all [[the inhabitants of Engerwitzdorf]], as well as data sets with all [[male and female first names]]. On top of that we have a list of social institutions like nursery homes and so on.

U>mhm, [[names]] would certainly interest me 

E>Or you looking for [[male]] or [[female]] [[first names]]?

U>either really, gender is not so much what i care about
    is there anything else this dataset might have to offer?

E>The data set tells you exactly how many children with a certain names were born in 2011
    Pretty amazing, huh?

U>that would be cool to know more about

E>Great. Let me send you the links to both the data set with the male and the data set with the female names
    Ladyies first: https://www.data.gv.at/kata...
    Aaaaand the gentlemen: https://www.data.gv.at/kata...
    Ladies* 

U>or actually, i need some specific data from the data set

E>What do you need?
    The number how many times a certain first name was used?
    The number of times*

U>yea, which ones are most used?

E>Amongst boys it's Alexander, Elias, Felix, Jakob,Robin and Simon. All these names were each used twice. Amongst girls it's Jasmin which was also used twice

U>thanks, I think thats all i need to know
