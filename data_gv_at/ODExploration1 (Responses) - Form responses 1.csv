    my portal was opendataportal.at 
oh yeah you are right sorry

    okay so how would you describe their content?my conent is really local, so to speak. Many datasets contain information about local businesses, products, administration etc.
    also most of the sets are in csv
    I just saw that there are many data sets about the WU and the course organisation

oh cool do you think there is a data set about our courses in wu
    maybe from last semester

    probably, the last one is from SS17

i would be know how much courses we have in a semester

    I don't know whether this is the number of the cources but in this csv I found Ihave 2577 course_ids

oh ok can you describe it more

    It essentially is a list with two columns, one course_id and one org_id
    course_id starts with 4001 and org_id with 3798
    there are double entries, so neither of these two is unique

it could be the right one

    okay good - regarding a completely different matter, I am interested in names of young people in a communal called engerwitzdorf
    ?

i found two different list with man and woman names in engerwitzdorf sorted after ages

    did you find anything about new names, maybe newborns or so?
    or is it possible to find out which names are the most popular, in relation to their age?

born dates are from 2011

    okay and what is the most popular name in this category?

Alexander 2 Elias 2 Felix 2 Jakob 2 Robin 2 Simon by men

    and also , what other data do you have , related to child births is Engerwitzdorf

Well, I did not find exactly what you search, but I can tell you statistics about the places where newborn live or the names they get

Hi! How can I help you?

What kind of data does your website contain?

It is an open Data Source that contains Data about various fields:work, culture, education, finances, geography, social stuff, healthcare, population, agriculture, ecology, politics, economics in Austria

What would interest you the most ?

Population

Okay, is there a specific region or city in austria from which you would like the Dataset( Steiermark, vorarlberg, Wien etc.) ? 
   
I'm interested in the population of upper-austria.

Perfect: Now what exactly are you looking for? Citizenship, Age, sex, names, wealth, general development, death rates or birth rates?

Names sound interesting

Perfect! I opened it as csv just now and would like to provide you with some further information: The dataset contains years, sex, rankings, the name and the number of people that had that name in that particular year
    It goes from 2015 until 2015
    is there a specific ranking, name or year that you want me to research for you?               e.g. most/second popular male name in 20XX? 
   
Is it possible to get the names of specific villages?

All our datasets are about Austria. There are sets about public services, geography, arts, sports, environment,...
So, yes we have 14 categories, which could be used to filter. You will find the set you need!

    yep

understand
    how are you ? ^^

    little in a hurry
    shall we start?

yes please
    just ask

    should we ask questions?

well I guess so

    so i should ask you anything about the data set?

i would like to get to know your first
    you attend wu right now right?

    yes
    you?

me too
    do you like the courses there?

    yeah its ok
    how do you like it?

i think theyre pretty ok
    as well
    do you know how many there are?

    in my course?
    30

I had always wanted to knor
    how many courses at wu?

    don't know exactly
    but, lets get back to the task if is ok?

ok

    we shouldn't ask direct quesions of the data set

just conversation ^^
    i was intersted

    yeah, but i think its okay to tell you that my task has somehting to do with names

thats interesting

    popular names

tell me more
    what kind of popular

    and its about a city in austria i have never heard of
    thats all i can tell you

well there are a lot of cities

    yeah i know

your task is about cities?

    let be more specific

please be

    its about a city in upper austria
    thats all i can say

interesting

    maybe you should browse your open data website and tell me what you find

and you have never heard of it or been there before

    now, tell me what youre looking for
    no, haven't head of the city before
    think it's rahter small
    that's maybe a little help
    tell me what you have to do

there are a lot of small cities in upper austria I guess

    i know

is it in a rather remote area?

    yes i think so
    near linz
    just checked on google maps
    whats your task?

well i cant tell you about my task explicitly I guess
    but it has something to do with universities

    ok. go on
    in austria?

yes

    can you tell me which uni?

well not explicitly
    but I let you guess 3 times

    about lectures?
    grades?
    how long students study maybe?
    give me some hints

well you arlready named it actually

    how long students in austria study?

You know, different univeristies offer different courses
    and these might be interesting
    just a tip

    ok, so it has something to do with courses

probably

    which courses are offered at austrian unis?

you are getting closer

    or how many courses are offered by unis?
    or many studends attend those courses?
    maybe some hint

its about lecutes yes
    these are offered by universities at different times
    maybe semesters?

    how many lectures an average students takes per semester?

stay away from students
    just about univeristies

    how many lectures are offered per semester by an university in austria?

thats nearly correct
    its about a specific univeristie
    y
    actually

    how many lectures are offered per semester by WU on average?

Imagine you are a student in 8th class and want to attend univeristy

    which courses are offered in the first semester at wu

so you start browsing the internet and might want to find out which courses are offered at a university

    or how many lectures there are to attend in the first semester at wu

and typically you might want to know what was offered in the last semester i guess
    alll courses
    because you would probably want to know what courses you could attend in the future

    oh okay

what is your guess?

    maybe somehing like the wu lehveranstalungsverzeichnis

good guess

    where you can look at all courses, but also in specific at which semester to take which course

yeah

    yes!
    ok, now back to my data set

alright

    the city is in the west of linz
    its rather small, say under 10.000 inhabitans
    sorry, in the east of linz
    it is near gallneunkirchen, i think i am allowed to say that
    just check google maps an tell me which city you see

i did
    engerwitzdorf?

- Geographie & Planung

Alright, do you need information about a specific state or about a specific town?

Luke:
Yes, it will be a town called ""Engerwitzdorf""

Ok, so you need information about a town in Upper Austria
Du you need information about age, gender, ""Erwerbsstatus"", ""Wanderungen"", ""Familien"", ""Geburten"" or ""Sterbefälle""?

Luke:
I hope its either in Familien or Geburten

jangoo:
Ok, I found entries for Engerwitzdorf in family data
Do you need the amount of families in total, the amount of families without children, or similar?

Luke:
Not really an amount, more a statistic about the names of the newbornes

Alright, there's a seperate dataset for this
So you need the most used first name for Engerwitzdorf?

Luke:
correct

jangoo:
male or female?
and for what year?

Luke:
nothing that exact, i need more of an overview

jangoo:
ok, there are two datasets published by Engerwitzdorf
One for male and one for female 
Both contain the information for the year 2011

Luke:
OK i just need the most popular names

jangoo:
Starting with the female dataset, there was only one name used more than once, which is ""Jasmin""
All other names in the data set were used exactly once

Luke:
oke, that was exactly what i needed, thanks!

For the males, 6 names were used twice: Alexander, Elias, Felix, Jakob, Robin, Simon

    Is Linz the city you are most interested in? 

     nope, a lot smaller would be prefarable

Okay, sure
    Maybe Engerwitzdorf?

    yea that sounds cool

Great. I just found a data set about the most important establishments and institutions in Engerwitzdorf. Does that sound appealing at all? 

    not really, don't you have anything more people related?

Didn't you say you wanted data related to culture?
    Just kidding, bear with me

    I did... at least i was pretty sure
    you know, might also be a little shizophrenic, you never know

We have a data set listing all the inhabitants of Engerwitzdorf, as well as data sets with all male and female first names. On top of that we have a list of social institutions like nursery homes and so on.

mhm, names would certainly interest me 

Or you looking for male or female first names?

    either really, gender is now so much what i care about
    is there anything else this dataset might have to offer?
    *not so much what i care about
    bare with me, i think we're getting somewhere, albeit slowly

The data set tells you exactly how many children with a certain names were born in 2011
    Pretty amazing, huh?

    that would be cool to know more about

Great. Let me send you the links to both the data set with the male and the data set with the female names

    Aaaaand the gentlemen: https://www.data.gv.at/kata...
    Ladies* 

    (as I am not supposed to go to the website, I believe we are done as of now, right?
    or actually, i need some specific data from the data set

What do you need?
    The number how many times a certain first name was used?
    The number of times*

    yea, which ones are most used?

Amongst boys it's Alexander, Elias, Felix, Jakob,Robin and Simon. All these names were each used twice. Amongst girls it's Jasmin which was also used twice

thanks, I think thats all i need to know 

Great. While we are at it I thought you could also get me some data

    sure, odp austria always glad to serve
    how can I help you
    we have got tons of data sets on different topics

I'm sure you do. But what really interests me is what you have on education

    let me check dear sir
    actually, not all that much, are you interested in a data set or news ?

You respect me more than my wife does

    well, let us hope she doesn't get jealous

A data set, of course

    perfect
    in this case, we only have one option, being a mapping of courses and organizations at wu, during different semesters
    I do hope you are into that kinda stuff?

I think it's fair to say that I have a fetish for stuff like tha

    so, which semester are you interested in? ws/ss?
    and which year? 14/15/16?

If SS stands for ""summer"" then that's what I'm after

    it sure does

Do you also have data about later years?

    sadly, 16 is the newest one we have
    2106
    2016

Oh, that's too bad

one moment 

    actually we do, it just has not been implemented into our categorical search yet

Great, what year is it about?

    2017

You are my hero
    Can you get me that data set?

    so, anything specific you would like to know ?
    sure I'll send it over right away

Oh yeah, almost forgot

    http://data.opendataportal....

So the data set contains a list of organisations and what else? 

     we only have course ID's and organization ID's listed, no corresponding names

Okay, nice. Could you give me a ""rough estimate"" of how many courses there were?

one moment 

    less than 1000 courses, but it is hard to evaluate, as some course ID's exist multiple times and some are left out entirely
    there is also no filtering tool available to remove duplicates

Okay, understood. Thank you very much for trying!

    there is a maximum of 871 courses
    that is the closest i can get, sadly

Thank you, darling 

It was my pleasure"	Not discussed	Not discussed	Not discussed
