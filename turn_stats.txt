A sure, odp austria always glad to serve. [[how can I help you]]G* . we have got [[tons]]Q* of data sets on different [[topics]]F*
U I'm sure you do. But what really interests me is what you have on [[education]]E*
A let me check dear sir. actually, not all that much, are you interested in a [[data set]]E* or [[news]]E* ?
U A [[data set]]E*, of course
A [[perfect]]+* . in this case, we only have one option, being a [[mapping of courses and organizations at wu]]E* , during different [[semesters]]F* . I do hope you are into that kinda stuff?

A [[2017]]E*
U [[You are my hero]]+* Can you get me that data set?
A so, anything specific you would like to know ? sure I'll send it over right away [[http://data.opendataportal....]]R*
U So the data set contains a list of organisations and what else?
A we only have course ID's and organization ID's listed, no corresponding names
U Okay, nice. Could you give me a ""rough estimate"" of how many courses there were?
A one moment less than 1000 courses, but it is hard to evaluate, as some course ID's exist multiple times and some are left out entirely there is also no filtering tool available to remove duplicates
U Okay, understood. Thank you very much for trying!
A there is a maximum of 871 courses that is the closest i can get, sadly
U Thank you, darling
A It was my pleasure
